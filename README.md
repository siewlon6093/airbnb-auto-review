# Airbnb-Auto-Review-For-Host
The script usually requires a few inputs from the user, such as the Airbnb account credentials, the listing ID for the property being reviewed, and the text of the review. Once the script has this information, it can log in to the Airbnb account, navigate to the listing page, and leave a review for the specified guest.
